The Slocode Foundation is a group of developers who are passionate about open source software. We are dedicated to creating and maintaining open source projects that are free to use and modify. Much of our work is focused on creating tools and libraries for compilers, interpreters, and other related software; however, we are open to working on any project that aligns with our mission.
