## About

![Slocode Logo](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/164181279?s=200&v=4)

The Slocode Foundation is a group of developers who are passionate about open source software. We are dedicated to creating and maintaining open source projects that are free to use and modify. Much of our work is focused on creating tools and libraries for compilers, interpreters, and other related software; however, we are open to working on any project that aligns with our mission. 

## Documentation

Our documentation is hosted on [Read the Docs](https://slocode-foundation.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

## Donations

Thank you so much for considering a donation; however, we do not accept donations. I believe that the best way to support us is to use our software and contribute to our projects. 

Instead of donating to us, consider donating to a organization such as the [Electronic Frontier Foundation](https://www.eff.org/), the [Free Software Foundation](https://www.fsf.org/), or the [Open Source Initiative](https://opensource.org/). These organizations are dedicated to supporting open source software and the rights of developers and users.
